### Instructions
1. copy a yml file that will work for the monitor
2. edit the yml file to add the name of the monitor you are creating
3. update the secret for the api key if needed
4. create a branch to execute from (named after the one you changed in the yml file)
5. edit the applitools config to have the correct urls and breakpoints
6. edit the test script itself if there is any functional flow or dialogs to clear/cookie warnings
